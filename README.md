## Project Overview

This project aims to create a prototype of a smart city system using IoT devices and sensors to monitor and manage various aspects of urban living, such as:

- Smart lighting
- Environmental monitoring (air quality, temperature, humidity)
- Smart parking
- Waste management
- Traffic management

The solution integrates sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud services to collect, process, and visualize data for city administrators and citizens.

## Features

- Real-time sensor data collection
- Remote monitoring and control
- Data visualization dashboards
- Automated alerts and notifications
- Modular and scalable architecture

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python, C/C++ (Arduino)
- **Microcontrollers:** Arduino, ESP8266/ESP32, Raspberry Pi (optional)
- **Sensors:** DHT11/DHT22 (temperature & humidity), MQ-135 (air quality), Ultrasonic sensors, LDR, IR sensors
- **Cloud/Backend:** Firebase, Thingspeak, or custom backend (can be extended)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for dashboards)
- **Communication Protocols:** MQTT, HTTP

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32 boards
- Sensors (DHT11/DHT22, MQ-135, Ultrasonic, LDR, IR, etc.)
- Jumper wires, breadboard, resistors, LEDs
- Wi-Fi connectivity
- (Optional) Raspberry Pi for advanced processing

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedantpatil1823/IOT-Project-Smart-city.git
   cd IOT-Project-Smart-city
   ```

2. **Hardware Assembly:**
   - Refer to `/hardware` directory for circuit diagrams and connection details.
   - Assemble the sensors and microcontrollers as per the schematics.

3. **Software Setup:**
   - Install Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
   - Open the relevant code files from `/code` directory.
   - Update the Wi-Fi credentials and backend endpoints in the code.
   - Upload the code to your microcontroller.

4. **Cloud Setup:**
   - Set up a Firebase/Thingspeak project or your preferred backend.
   - Update the backend keys/configs in the code.

5. **Dashboard:**
   - Open `/dashboard` for web-based visualization (if available).
   - Configure to point to your backend.
